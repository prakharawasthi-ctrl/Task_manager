# Task Manager

This Task Manager App is a web application built using Node.js and Express.js, with EJS as the templating engine. The app allows users to efficiently manage their tasks by providing features to create, update, delete, and view tasks. It is designed with a clean and intuitive user interface to enhance productivity and ease of use.

## Key Features:

+ **Task Creation**: Easily add new tasks with a user-friendly form.

+ **Task Editing**: Update existing tasks to reflect changes in requirements or priorities.

+ **Task Viewing**: View all tasks in a list format, with details of each task for better management.

This project demonstrates my skills in full-stack development using Node.js and Express.js, and showcases how to use EJS for dynamic templating.
